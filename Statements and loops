#Make a loop over integer numbers from 1 to 40.
#If x is divided by 5 then print a message 'x is divided by 5'.
#If x is divided by 7 then print a message 'x is divided by 7'.
#If x is divided by 5 and 7 then print a message 'x is divided by 5 and 7'.
#Skip x = 13.
#If x is not divided by 5 and x is not divided by 7 
#then print a message 'x is not important'.
#Prepare two solutions with 'while' and 'for' loops.
